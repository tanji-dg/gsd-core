description: Create context handoff when pausing work mid-phase

<objective>
Create `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions. With the `autopause` capability enabled the pause is one operation — the committed handoff is cleared and resumed automatically; pass `--keep-session` to stay paused instead. Filenames are keyed per session (`HANDOFF.latest.<role_id>.json` / `HANDOFF.<session_id>.json`) and the pause is recorded per session (`.planning/sessions/<session_id>.json`) — STATE.md `status:` is never set to `paused`, so concurrent sessions sharing one `.planning/` keep working.

Routes to the pause-work workflow which handles:
- Current phase detection from recent files
- Complete state gathering (position, completed work, remaining work, decisions, blockers)
- Handoff file creation with all context sections
- Git commit as WIP
- Resume instructions
</objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/pause-work.md
</execution_context>

<context>
State and phase progress are gathered in-workflow with targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
If `--report` is in $ARGUMENTS:
Read and execute `~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/session-report.md` end-to-end.

**Follow the pause-work workflow**.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Phase directory detection
2. State gathering with user clarifications
3. Handoff file writing with timestamp
4. Git commit
5. Confirmation with resume instructions
</process>
