<purpose>
Create structured `.planning/HANDOFF.json` and `.continue-here.md` handoff files to preserve complete work state across sessions. The JSON provides machine-readable state for `/gsd:resume-work`; the markdown provides human-readable context. Both filenames are keyed by the session's **role** when it has one (e.g. `HANDOFF.latest.design.json`) — the role is the identity that survives `/clear` and restarts, so the resuming session can find its own handoff and claim it. Sessions without a role fall back to a session-id key (`HANDOFF.<session_id>.json`) so concurrent sessions paused in the same directory still don't overwrite each other.

**Pause is per session, not per project.** Several sessions (coordinator, hardware operator, design reviewer, …) may share one `.planning/`; the others keep working while this one pauses. A session's paused state is represented **solely by the existence of its handoff file** under `.planning/` — the statusline, `/gsd:next` and `/gsd:resume-work` all read it from there. **Never set STATE.md `status:` to `paused` and never add a `Paused At:` line** — that would flip every session's status and there is no GSD path back out of it. The shared `## Session` block still gets a heartbeat (`state record-session`) for backward compatibility, and the same fields are mirrored to this session's own record `.planning/sessions/<session_id>.json`.

## Context Detection

Determine what kind of work is being paused and set the handoff destination accordingly:

```bash
# Key the handoff filename so that (a) concurrent sessions paused in the same
# working directory never overwrite each other, and (b) the session that later
# resumes can tell which handoff is its own.
#
# Preferred key: the session's ROLE (role_id — see the gather step). A session id
# is NOT a usable key for (b): `/clear` and restarts issue a new
# CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, so a session-id-keyed file is never matched by the
# session that comes back, never gets deleted, and piles up (18+ stale files
# were observed in one repo). The role survives that boundary. The role-keyed
# file is a single "latest" slot per role — a new pause of the same role
# overwrites it — and its presence means "this role is paused and unclaimed";
# resume-work claims it (rename) and deletes it once the role is restored.
#
# Fallback key: session id, for sessions with no role (older behaviour). Legacy
# unkeyed names are used only when the env var is unset (older client).
session_id="${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-}"
role_id=""   # set in the gather step; leave empty when this session has no role
if [ -n "$role_id" ]; then
  continue_here_name=".continue-here.latest.${role_id}.md"
  handoff_json_name="HANDOFF.latest.${role_id}.json"
elif [ -n "$session_id" ]; then
  continue_here_name=".continue-here.${session_id}.md"
  handoff_json_name="HANDOFF.${session_id}.json"
else
  continue_here_name=".continue-here.md"
  handoff_json_name="HANDOFF.json"

# Check for active phase

```

- **Phase work**: active phase directory → handoff to `.planning/phases/XX-name/${continue_here_name}`
- **Spike work**: active spike directory or spike-related files (no active phase) → handoff to `.planning/spikes/SPIKE-NNN/${continue_here_name}` (create directory if needed)
- **Sketch work**: active sketch directory (no active phase/spike) → handoff to `.planning/sketches/${continue_here_name}`
- **Deliberation work**: active deliberation file (no phase/spike/sketch) → handoff to `.planning/deliberations/${continue_here_name}`
- **Research work**: research notes exist but no phase/spike/sketch/deliberation → handoff to `.planning/${continue_here_name}`
- **Default**: no detectable context → handoff to `.planning/${continue_here_name}`, note the ambiguity in `<current_state>`

If phase is detected, proceed with phase handoff path. Otherwise use the first matching non-phase path above.
</step>

<step name="gather">
**Collect complete state for handoff:**

1. **Current position**: Which phase, which plan, which task
2. **Session role** (if this session was operating under an assigned role — e.g. a named role in a multi-session/multi-role workflow such as "coordinator", "hardware operator", "design reviewer"): capture it verbatim as `role` so resume restores the same role instead of dropping it. Prefer the project's own role registry as the source of truth when it has one (e.g. a per-session role file the project's statusline reads) over recalling the role from conversation — the two must not disagree.
   - Also derive **`role_id`**: a short filesystem-safe slug of the role (`[a-z0-9-]+`, ASCII only — no spaces, no non-ASCII, since it becomes part of a filename). If the project defines its roles in files (e.g. `docs/roles/<slug>.md`), use that slug verbatim; otherwise lowercase the role's English name and join words with `-` (`hardware operator` → `hardware-operator`). Set `role_id` in the detect step's shell before computing the filenames. Leave it empty when the session has no role.
3. **Work completed**: What got done this session
4. **Work remaining**: What's left in current plan/phase
5. **Decisions made**: Key decisions and rationale
6. **Blockers/issues**: Anything stuck
7. **Human actions pending**: Things that need manual intervention (MCP setup, API keys, approvals, manual testing)
8. **Background processes**: Any running servers/watchers that were part of the workflow
9. **Files modified**: What's changed but not committed
10. **Outstanding async external jobs**: any `.planning/async-jobs/*.json` manifests for non-terminal jobs — record job id, backend, status, expected artifacts, verification + resume commands, and any watcher/daemon state. Do NOT cancel the external job; it keeps running across the pause.
11. **Blocking constraints**: Anti-patterns or methodological failures encountered during this session that a resuming agent MUST be aware of before proceeding. Only include items discovered through actual failure — not warnings or predictions. Assign each constraint a `severity`:
   - `blocking` — The resuming agent MUST demonstrate understanding before proceeding. The discuss-phase and execute-phase workflows will enforce a mandatory understanding check.
   - `advisory` — Important context but does not gate resumption.

**Do not block on the user.** This workflow may be running unattended (an external watcher can send `/gsd:pause-work` while the user is away — see the `gsd-resume-hook` SessionStart hook). Ask a clarifying question only when the user is clearly present and the answer changes what gets written; otherwise write `unknown` for the item and say why in `context_notes` — never leave the pause half-written waiting for an answer.

**Role source of truth**: when the project keeps a role registry (a per-session role file, `docs/roles/`, a statusline register command, …), take `role` and `role_id` from there — the registry's slug is the `role_id`, verbatim; do not re-derive it from the role's wording. Only derive the slug yourself when the project has no registry. If the registry has no entry for this session, leave both empty and note it.

**Also inspect SUMMARY.md files for false completions:**
```bash
# Check for placeholder content in existing summaries
grep -l "To be filled\|placeholder\|TBD" .planning/phases/*/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```
Report any summaries with placeholder content as incomplete items.

**`uncommitted_files` is measured, never asserted (#3968).** Populate it from an actual call,
not from memory — a narrated `[]` over a dirty tree is how 14 plans' worth of uncommitted
code went invisible in the wild:
```bash
UNCOMMITTED=$(git status --porcelain)
# One array entry per line ("XY path"); truncate the list at 50 entries and note the
# elided count, but NEVER round it to empty — a non-empty porcelain output is the single
# most load-bearing fact a resume session needs.

# BLOCKING CONSTRAINTS — Read Before Anything Else

> These are not suggestions. Each constraint below was discovered through failure.
> Acknowledge each one explicitly before proceeding.

- [ ] CONSTRAINT: [name] — [what it is] — [structural mitigation required]

**Do not proceed until all boxes are checked.**

_If no constraints have been identified yet, remove this section._

## Critical Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Severity | Prevention Mechanism |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| [pattern name] | [what it is and how it manifested] | blocking | [structural step that prevents recurrence — not acknowledgment] |
| [pattern name] | [what it is and how it manifested] | advisory | [guidance for avoiding it] |

**Severity values:** `blocking` — resuming agent must pass understanding check before proceeding. `advisory` — important context, does not gate resumption.

_Remove rows that do not apply. The discuss-phase and execute-phase workflows parse this table and enforce a mandatory understanding check for any `blocking` rows._

<current_state>
[Where exactly are we? Immediate context]
</current_state>

<completed_work>

Completed Tasks:
- Task 1: [name] - Done
- Task 2: [name] - Done
- Task 3: [name] - In progress, [what's done]
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Task 3: [what's left]
- Task 4: Not started
- Task 5: Not started
</remaining_work>

## Required Reading (in order)
<!-- List documents the resuming agent must read before acting -->
1. [document] — [why it matters]
1. `.planning/METHODOLOGY.md` (if it exists) — project analytical lenses; apply before any assumption analysis

## Critical Anti-Patterns (do NOT repeat these)
<!-- Mistakes discovered this session that must be structurally avoided -->
- [ANTI-PATTERN]: [what it is] → [structural mitigation]

## Infrastructure State
<!-- Running services, external state, environment specifics -->
- [service/env]: [current state]

## Pre-Execution Critique Required
<!-- Fill in ONLY if pausing between design and execution (e.g. spike design done, not yet run) -->
- Design artifact: [path]
- Critique focus: [key questions the critic should probe]
- Gate: Do NOT begin execution until critique is complete and design is revised

<context>
[Mental state, what were you thinking, the plan]
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: [specific first action when resuming]
</next_action>
```

Be specific enough for a fresh Claude to understand immediately.

Use `current-timestamp` for last_updated field. You can use init todos (which provides timestamps) or call directly:
```bash
timestamp=$(gsd_run query current-timestamp full --raw)
```
</step>

<step name="skills">
**Skill capture (optional, before committing).** Look back over this session for material that belongs in a reusable skill rather than only in the handoff:

- a procedure worked out by trial and error that will be needed again
- a trap that cost time and whose fix is a fixed command string or ordering
- an existing skill that turned out to be wrong, incomplete, or hard to find from the action path

If there is such material, create or update the skill now (the `skill-creator` skill for a new one; edit its `SKILL.md` directly for a fix) and record what changed in `<decisions_made>` and in the confirm step. If there is nothing, write one line `skills: no change` in the handoff's `<context>` — do not invent a skill to have something to report.
</step>

<step name="notify">
**Notify the user only if they must act.** The user may not be watching this session. If, and only if, the pause ends with one of:

- a decision only the user can make (a blocking `human_actions_pending`)
- an external/physical state the user must see before the next session (a rig left in a temporary state, a tool left open, …)
- a failure the resuming session cannot recover from on its own

and the project configured a notifier — `.planning/config.json` `autopause.notify_command` (a shell command; the one-line message is passed as `$GSD_PAUSE_MESSAGE` / `%GSD_PAUSE_MESSAGE%` and appended as the last argument) — send exactly one message:

```bash
notify_cmd=$(gsd_run config-get autopause.notify_command --raw 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -n "$notify_cmd" ] && [ "$notify_cmd" != "null" ]; then
  GSD_PAUSE_MESSAGE="⏸ pause [<role or role_id>]: <one line — what the user must decide/check>" sh -c "$notify_cmd \"\$GSD_PAUSE_MESSAGE\"" || true
fi
```

Otherwise send nothing (a routine pause is not news). Note in the handoff whether a notification was sent.
</step>

<step name="record_session">
**Record the pause as this session's continuity heartbeat** — through the verb, never by hand-editing STATE.md:

```bash
# --session keys the per-session record (.planning/sessions/<session_id>.json);
# --role / --role-id carry this session's role so resume-work and the statusline
# can match the role-keyed handoff back to it. Omit the role flags when the
# session has no role. The STATE.md `## Session` block is updated as before.
gsd_run state record-session \
  --stopped-at "Paused: [context] [XX-name] task [X]/[Y] — [one-line what was in flight]" \
  --resume-file "[handoff-path with ${continue_here_name}]" \
  ${session_id:+--session "$session_id"} \
  ${role_id:+--role "[role verbatim]" --role-id "$role_id"}
```

Rules:
- **Never set STATE.md `status:` to `paused` or add a `Paused At:` line.** Pause is per-session — represented solely by `.planning/${handoff_json_name}`. Other sessions share this `.planning/` and keep working; a project-wide `paused` would be wrong for them and nothing clears it.
- Do not edit `## Session` / `## Session Continuity` by hand; `state record-session` owns that block.
- If `state record-session` rejects `--session` (older installed gsd-tools), rerun it without the session/role flags — the handoff files alone still carry the pause.
</step>

<step name="commit">
```bash
gsd_run query commit "wip: [context-name] paused at [X]/[Y]" --files [handoff-path with ${continue_here_name}] .planning/${handoff_json_name} ${session_id:+.planning/sessions/${session_id}.json}
```
(`.planning/sessions/<session_id>.json` is included only when `state record-session` reported a `session_record`.)
